## Objectives

```diff
+ The REST API is stateless, and therefore helps functions scale horizontally. 

In step 1 of the Battlestax tutorial, we will:

+ Create test cases to check that our API call is working correctly
 
+ Build the API call to Astra to create a game document, based on the requirements from our test
```

## 1. Setup your environment

**✅ Step 1a: Checkout expected branch**

1. Switch to branch `step-1`
* For this part of the tutorial, we will be working in step-1 branch. Switch branches by using the following command in the terminal

📘 **Command to execute**

`git checkout step-1`

## 2. Making a Serverless endpoint using Netlify functions

**✅ Step 2a: Check out the `functions` folder**

Each file in our `functions` folder represents a REST API endpoint implemented as a **serverless** function _(we'll get to this in a moment)_. For now, take a look at the `helloWorld.js` file inside the `functions` folder.

![insert](./tutorial/insert.png)

At this point, this REST API endpoint is stubbed out. If we use this as it, it will simply give us back `{"hello":"world"}`.

```javascript
exports.handler = async (event, context) => {
  return {
    statusCode: 200,
    body: JSON.stringify({ hello: "world" }),
  };
};
```

**✅ Step 2b: Test the REST API with a browser**

Be sure that the app you had running in the previous step has been shutdown (`Ctrl-C`). To try the REST API along with the front end, in the terminal use the command:

📘 **Command to execute**

`npm run dev`
* This will give you the UI plus run the `helloWorld` function in the background.

### GitPod

* See the UI running at: `https://8888-<your_uid>.<your_region>.gitpod.io`
* See the end point at: `https://8888-<your_uid>.<your_region>.gitpod.io/.netlify/functions/helloWorld`

*_Notice the port, GitPod generated ID, and the GitPod region in the URL below at each arrow. This should automatically be generated for you when you run `npm run dev`. Just paste `/.netlify/functions/helloWorld` on to the end in order to get to the correct endpoint._*

📗 **Expected output**

![test functions output](./tutorial/netlify-helloWorld-output.png)

### LOCAL

* See the UI running at: `localhost:8888`
* See the end point at: `localhost:8888/.netlify/functions/helloWorld`

### You should see this output at the endpoint
`{"hello":"world"}`

This is our **serverless** function giving us back the "Hello World" example.

**✅ Step 2c: Run the existing unit tests**

✔️ Have a look at the `/test/helloWorld.test.js` file, this does not do much at this point. This basically tests the `helloWorld` function to ensure that we get "world" in our response, and hence we would know that the function is working correctly.

✔️ The way we are going to approach writing our tests is by asking the question "What does our endpoint need to do?". We want our function to 
create a new game on Astra (provision a new game) --  and we provide the API with a random game code so this can work.


```javascript
const insertGame = require("../functions/insertGame");

it("should return a JSON response", async () => {
  const response = await insertGame.handler();
  const responseJson = JSON.parse(response.body);
  expect(responseJson.hello).toBe("world");
});
```

Run the test to try it out:

📘 **Command to execute**

```bash
npm run test:functions
```
