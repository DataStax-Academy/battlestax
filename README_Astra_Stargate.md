**Developers...**
- Do you like learning query languages (CQL, N1QL, GQL, cypher, gremlin….) No. Save my JSON, give it to me back when I need it
ORM / Spring Data are so popular nowadays
- Do you care about how your data is stored ?
Physical data model part of the interface…yike
Create structures based on queries
- Do you like installing and running Databases locally
especially distributed databases
especially with datasets and integration tests

**Operators and Databases Administrators…**
- Do you allow developers to execute direct queries against your DB ?
- Do you like opening port ranges like 0-65536 to allow communications with applications, especially in the cloud.
- Do you like creating dedicated projects and hiring people just to create APIs to expose an existing treatment (digital transformation FTW)

Stargate is a framework used to customize all aspects of data access. It is deployed between client applications and a database to provide an abstraction layer that can be used to shape your data access to fit your application’s needs.
